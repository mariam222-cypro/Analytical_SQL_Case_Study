# Online Retail Dataset Analytical SQL Case Study

This case study involves analyzing an online retail dataset to identify segments of customers and their behavioral patterns over different time intervals. The analysis will help predict churn and provide customized service to customers to generate more profit.

## Introduction

The marketing department of the retail company is trying to increase revenue. In an effort to do so, they want to identify segments of customers and their behavioral patterns over different time intervals. Data-driven insight into these trends should help the marketing team determine what might be good for the business or not.

## Prepare and Process

The data used for this analysis was collected between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail company. The dataset contains all the transactions, and the company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. We used analytical SQL and PostgresSQL to predict the sale of items and to predict the products that have been purchased previously and are most likely to be bought in the next order.

## Analyses and Sharing

We used several tools for the analysis, including PostgresSQL and Tableau. We visualized the data to explore the following:

1. Total price and total quantity per invoice
2. The product selling the most
3. The % of each product from total profits
4. Products usually sold together
5. The most selling month
6. The average order size by customer
7. Top-selling products by month
8. Monthly revenue growth rate

## Act and Recommend

Based on the analyses, we made the following recommendations:

1. The most selling month during 2010 and 2011 is November, with a profit of 45,633.38 dollars.
2. The product with the most quantity sold is not the product generating the most profits.
3. The product with ID 84879 is generating the most profits.
4. The top products that are sold together the most are "20724”/"2235”.
5. The monetary model for customer behavior shows that seven customers need attention.

## Conclusion

Analyzing the retail dataset using analytical SQL and PostgresSQL helps identify customer behavior patterns and generate insights for recommendations that increase revenue.
